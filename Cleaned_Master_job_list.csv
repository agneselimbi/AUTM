,Software Engineer - Full Stack (Remote),6 days ago,05/20/2022,Path Mental Health,"Austin, Texas, United States, TX",,,,,,"Role Overview
As a member of Path’s Engineering team, you’ll be able to focus on doing your best work and create a real impact with a team of like-minded people who waste minimal time on unnecessary overhead. While we’re looking for software engineers of all levels of seniority, we’re excited by candidates who enjoy and are capable of working on a small team with a fast-growing product. We’re looking for generalists who can work across the stack and those who gravitate towards frontend, backend, or infrastructure engineering. We recognize people are passionate about different areas and you'll have the option to be involved in as much (or as little) as you’d like. 
Today we build products for 2 primary customers; patients and therapists: 
On the patient side, we’re focused on a fast and delightful enrollment where patients can find a therapist that’s right for them and who takes their insurance in less than 10 minutes. 
On the therapist side, we’re building a full set of practice management software including patient recruiting, scheduling, patient notes, referrals, and more. Our therapists spend all day in Path and their experience needs to be fantastic. 
This is a really unique opportunity to help build on the foundational engineering infrastructure at a company where the business is already humming and we have thousands of users every day. If this sounds exciting and energizing, we’d love to talk!
Technical Stack
Path's systems are written in Ruby on Rails, with React frontends. We use Postgres for our databases and everything is hosted on AWS. We also make heavy use of existing tools like Salesforce, Airtable, Typeform, etc. This has enabled us to scale very quickly with a small team but we’re now ready to bring much of this work in-house. We’re standing up the technical foundation that will power the future of the company. It doesn’t matter if you don’t have experience with the specific technologies in our stack, we’d still love to connect with you!  
What You'll Be Doing
As an engineer at Path, you’ll have endless opportunities to help build, shape, and lay the tracks for future technical infrastructure, and provide input on product, design, and cultural decisions, if that interests you.  
In this role, you will:
Spend most of your time writing code. We are a small team with minimal overhead and you’ll spend the vast majority of your day actually writing code. 
Build, test, and deploy software in a continuous manner (we deploy throughout the week, if not every day)
Work across the company to shape the future of the engineering organization. We are getting started and if there’s a topic you’re passionate about like recruiting, deployment, infrastructure, tools, etc., we’re excited for you to contribute. 
Actively shape the product direction by participating in product reviews, design reviews, and customer research. 
Create and contribute to technical specs and testing/rollout plans.
Work with external and internal stakeholders to ensure we’re solving the right problems.
Mentor and sponsor your teammates to help them grow. 
What We’re Looking For
Even if you don’t have experience with the specific technologies in our stack, we’d love to talk to you! An ideal candidate would be someone with the following traits:
Self-managed work-ethic. We are building a highly focused, low overhead team and trust people to get their work done on their own initiative 
Shipped customer-focused software at scale
Problem solvers, people who are going to be able to spot problems in existing systems and/or people who come with a solution-oriented approach 
Working experience from a technology company or technology startup 
Collaborative working style, success working across functions
Clear and concise written, verbal, and technical communication skills
Experience writing well-structured, well-tested, and maintainable code
Demonstrated ability to mentor and teach others

Atlassian can hire people in any country where we have a legal entity. Assuming you have eligible working rights and a sufficient time zone overlap with your team, you can choose to work remotely or return to an office as they reopen (unless it’s necessary for your role to be performed in the office). Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company.

Halp is looking for a talented Full Stack Software Engineer with a knack for solving problems and a passion for helping team members and customers. Our product and engineering team builds software that helps technical operations teams dramatically reduce ticket resolution time, increase user satisfaction, and amplify productivity. Every engineer at Halp touches all parts of our product lifecycle and has input into developing the future of our SaaS product suite.

As a Full Stack Software Engineer, you will play an essential role in evolving Halp, making a large impact on our rapidly growing product. We seek out action-oriented individuals that aren’t afraid to voice their opinion and value healthy debate as much as collaboration.

You will contribute to the core of Halp, surfacing intuitive experiences inside Slack and our web product to create and triage tickets that impact more than 100,000 employees at future-thinking companies like Slack, Pinterest, and GitHub.

As a product-driven company, our engineering team’s main goal is continuously building empathy with our customers’ core problems to better execute against our product strategy. You’ll own projects end-to-end and will architect, code, test, and ship web technology. You’ll also be involved in brainstorming, designing, and prototyping evolutions of the Halp product suite.
What You’ll Do:
Own code all the way through to production and verify it’s solving the right problem for the customer.
Ship well-tested, secure, reliable, and maintainable code within committed timelines that delights product users.
Be a great agile team member. Ship fast, small increments to iterate quickly towards building working software that solves real problems.
React to how our product is used in the wild, and help to fix bugs and production issues as they occur.
Understand the reasoning behind key product and design decisions and contribute good solutions to implementation and architecture discussions.
Support fellow engineers through peer code reviews and constructive discussions that concern architecture, data model, and feature implementation decisions.
Take initiative to drive new projects, reduce complexity, and unblock others.
Collaborate with cross-functional team members to influence product strategy and direction.
Lead key initiatives to improve a product that our customers seriously love. Seriously. See what Josh Senick, Senior Manager, Business Technology Operations, Slack, had to say about Halp: “The second I saw it, I said where do I sign? How do we get this, because this is exactly what I want to do. This is the tool I’ve been wanting since my first day at Slack.""
Who You Are:
A results-oriented engineer who is comfortable with higher levels of ambiguity
A proactive communicator with great follow-through
Excited about learning from your coworkers and collaborating with people with diverse perspectives
Willing to voice your opinion but okay with not always being right
Trend towards focusing on the customer problem and treating technology as a means to an end
Requirements:
At least 3 years of experience in an engineering role at a software company
An extensive background in front-end engineering and API design and implementation
Able to technically lead a product initiative from design to production
Able to guide scaling a platform across distributed services
Strong competency in all of the following: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, MongoDB
Nice to Have:
Experience working with help desk or ticketing platforms
Our perks & benefits

To support you at work and play, our perks and benefits include ample time off, an annual education budget, paid volunteer days, and so much more.
