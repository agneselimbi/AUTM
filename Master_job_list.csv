Our Team: Relationship Awareness Product

The Financial Sector sounds super interesting right? Yea, don't worry about that. No one on the team started with a financial background but we still love what we do and have fun with new technologies every day. (But if you really do like financial numbers and calculating capital returns and such, wow, even better)

Our small team of developers handle the ingestion of our client’s “big data”. This data is the lifeblood of many of our product offerings so we make sure millions of records can flow smoothly through our pipelines.

Our Software Approach

Our small team maintains a lot of control over how we work and deliver our solutions. We want to share a glimpse into how we approach development on the team so you can see if this is a good fit for you.
We like to stay nimble and move fast. This lets us react quickly to any problems and deliver fixes so fast it ""wows"" the customer. Production pushes can happen multiple times a day - when your code is ready, it goes out.
But never move so fast that it causes problems. Our developers are expected to understand and own features and create automated tests where applicable. We are happy to push the deadline out if that means our customers get a better solution.
Continually monitor and improve even after a ticket is “Done”. We like to always be improving ourselves and the best way to do that is to measure and monitor constantly so we know what and how things can be made better.
Got an idea? Bring it up. Many of our technology choices are driven from team members and we love to stay fresh on great ideas.
Our Stack

We are primarily a Microsoft shop so that means we deal with C# heavily. However, a large chunk of our ETL pipeline is Python (with Spark/Pandas/Numpy). Our team focuses mostly in the ""business layer"" handling the logic and flow of data. We do dabble in some backend storage (SQL, Blob Storage) and maintain our own Vue dashboard for monitoring our pipelines, but for the most part, these account for only a fraction of our days.

All of our stack exists in Azure so if you enjoy cloud development or want to learn to enjoy cloud development, we have you covered.

Software Engineer - Full Stack (Remote),6 days ago,5/20/2022,Path Mental Health,"Austin, Texas, United States, TX",,,,,,"Role Overview
As a member of Path’s Engineering team, you’ll be able to focus on doing your best work and create a real impact with a team of like-minded people who waste minimal time on unnecessary overhead. While we’re looking for software engineers of all levels of seniority, we’re excited by candidates who enjoy and are capable of working on a small team with a fast-growing product. We’re looking for generalists who can work across the stack and those who gravitate towards frontend, backend, or infrastructure engineering. We recognize people are passionate about different areas and you'll have the option to be involved in as much (or as little) as you’d like. 
Today we build products for 2 primary customers; patients and therapists: 
On the patient side, we’re focused on a fast and delightful enrollment where patients can find a therapist that’s right for them and who takes their insurance in less than 10 minutes. 
On the therapist side, we’re building a full set of practice management software including patient recruiting, scheduling, patient notes, referrals, and more. Our therapists spend all day in Path and their experience needs to be fantastic. 
This is a really unique opportunity to help build on the foundational engineering infrastructure at a company where the business is already humming and we have thousands of users every day. If this sounds exciting and energizing, we’d love to talk!
Technical Stack
Path's systems are written in Ruby on Rails, with React frontends. We use Postgres for our databases and everything is hosted on AWS. We also make heavy use of existing tools like Salesforce, Airtable, Typeform, etc. This has enabled us to scale very quickly with a small team but we’re now ready to bring much of this work in-house. We’re standing up the technical foundation that will power the future of the company. It doesn’t matter if you don’t have experience with the specific technologies in our stack, we’d still love to connect with you!  
What You'll Be Doing
As an engineer at Path, you’ll have endless opportunities to help build, shape, and lay the tracks for future technical infrastructure, and provide input on product, design, and cultural decisions, if that interests you.  
In this role, you will:
Spend most of your time writing code. We are a small team with minimal overhead and you’ll spend the vast majority of your day actually writing code. 
Build, test, and deploy software in a continuous manner (we deploy throughout the week, if not every day)
Work across the company to shape the future of the engineering organization. We are getting started and if there’s a topic you’re passionate about like recruiting, deployment, infrastructure, tools, etc., we’re excited for you to contribute. 
Actively shape the product direction by participating in product reviews, design reviews, and customer research. 
Create and contribute to technical specs and testing/rollout plans.
Work with external and internal stakeholders to ensure we’re solving the right problems.
Mentor and sponsor your teammates to help them grow. 
What We’re Looking For
Even if you don’t have experience with the specific technologies in our stack, we’d love to talk to you! An ideal candidate would be someone with the following traits:
Self-managed work-ethic. We are building a highly focused, low overhead team and trust people to get their work done on their own initiative 
Shipped customer-focused software at scale
Problem solvers, people who are going to be able to spot problems in existing systems and/or people who come with a solution-oriented approach 
Working experience from a technology company or technology startup 
Collaborative working style, success working across functions
Clear and concise written, verbal, and technical communication skills
Experience writing well-structured, well-tested, and maintainable code
Demonstrated ability to mentor and teach others

You and the team will design and build technically innovative solutions that empower all teams at Shop to build great products for buyers and sellers. You will build highly scalable, performant, and reliable products that benefit directly from the work you do. You will maintain a high bar for quality and lead and mentor other engineers. And of course, you’ll be hands-on in the code and contribute technically.
Back End Development
On the Back End development side, we’re looking for engineers with a passion for solving tough problems with performant code to power Shop and Shopify APIs and data processing pipelines. Our teams deploy new code many times a day across Shop and Shopify backend systems, we are mindful of the impact our code has on performance, and our production scale is large. With billions of requests a day, we’re serving many millions of buyers and millions of sellers who will see your work within seconds – an important and incredibly rewarding responsibility. While Shop has its own services, we have plenty of interactions and integrations with the Shopify core codebases. There is no red tape and we leverage this fact whenever it supports our goal of building high quality products faster. Shopify is the largest Ruby on Rails application in the world and we're a big part of the Rails community.
Mobile Development (React Native, Android & iOS)
On the Mobile development side, we’re looking for engineers with a passion for shipping performant, high-quality mobile consumer experiences. The Shop app is built using React Native for which we have developed sophisticated tooling and development pipelines that allow us to more easily build and maintain high-quality features at speed. We leverage seamless over-the-air updates to distribute internal testing of work-in-progress pull requests to thousands of staff users and ship production versions with server-side-controlled feature flags and end-user performance monitoring. This allows us to move at a fast pace with feedback loops and iterations in the collaboration between our development teams and the design and product management teams. These features combined with our many millions of daily users give opportunities to do early-stage testing and quickly learn how our technology and products perform and if we are bringing value to our users.
Front End Development
On the Front End development, we’re looking for engineers who appreciate the blurred line between web and mobile development. We’ve come a long way at reducing the distinction between web and mobile development and will continue to leverage the best of these two disciplines to make development across both areas easier and more impactful. As a frontend engineer, you’ll work with web and mobile products in close collaboration with other software development teams, designers, product managers, and marketers to not only build incredible web products and marketing campaigns but also shipping those features in our mobile products. Besides Ruby on Rails for some web projects we use the latest web standards in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and modern technologies and frameworks like Typescript, React, GraphQL, Apollo, to develop great web and mobile applications that scale and perform well on all devices. We have well-established onboarding and growth programs to help engineers bridge the gap between web and mobile development. In fact, many of our mobile engineers come from a web development background and are now some of the most important contributors to the mobile products our users love and use daily.
What you’ll do as a Tech Lead Software Engineer at Shop:
Learn and grow constantly to feed your passion for self-improvement and make those around you better
Design and build highly available, resilient and scalable platform primitives & API
Work through problems with your team, roll up your sleeves, form an opinion and advocate for engineering-specific roadmap items
Collaborate with other Shopify and Shop leaders, executives and external partners to provide the best experiences for our users
Experience and skills that are important for success in this role:
A proven track record of leading the technical direction for software development teams — strong technical mentorship is a must
Experience building either large scale, high throughput systems (backend) or high-quality and high-impact user experiences (frontend, mobile)
High level of fluency with and experience using technologies and frameworks like (but not limited to) some of our most-used languages - Ruby on Rails, GraphQL, Java/JEE, Node.js, PHP, Python, React or React Native, Golang, Kubernetes - or deep experience with any object-oriented language and relevant transferrable technologies
A passion for efficiency and collaboration, with a history of establishing great relationships across UX, Product Management, Product Marketing, and Data teams 
A commitment and drive for quality, technical excellence and results
Curiosity and passion to constantly learn new things; Shopify and Shop changes fast, and we need the people who work here to be able to change and learn fast too

Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company.

Halp is looking for a talented Full Stack Software Engineer with a knack for solving problems and a passion for helping team members and customers. Our product and engineering team builds software that helps technical operations teams dramatically reduce ticket resolution time, increase user satisfaction, and amplify productivity. Every engineer at Halp touches all parts of our product lifecycle and has input into developing the future of our SaaS product suite.

As a Full Stack Software Engineer, you will play an essential role in evolving Halp, making a large impact on our rapidly growing product. We seek out action-oriented individuals that aren’t afraid to voice their opinion and value healthy debate as much as collaboration.

You will contribute to the core of Halp, surfacing intuitive experiences inside Slack and our web product to create and triage tickets that impact more than 100,000 employees at future-thinking companies like Slack, Pinterest, and GitHub.

As a product-driven company, our engineering team’s main goal is continuously building empathy with our customers’ core problems to better execute against our product strategy. You’ll own projects end-to-end and will architect, code, test, and ship web technology. You’ll also be involved in brainstorming, designing, and prototyping evolutions of the Halp product suite.
What You’ll Do:
Own code all the way through to production and verify it’s solving the right problem for the customer.
Ship well-tested, secure, reliable, and maintainable code within committed timelines that delights product users.
Be a great agile team member. Ship fast, small increments to iterate quickly towards building working software that solves real problems.
React to how our product is used in the wild, and help to fix bugs and production issues as they occur.
Understand the reasoning behind key product and design decisions and contribute good solutions to implementation and architecture discussions.
Support fellow engineers through peer code reviews and constructive discussions that concern architecture, data model, and feature implementation decisions.
Take initiative to drive new projects, reduce complexity, and unblock others.
Collaborate with cross-functional team members to influence product strategy and direction.
Lead key initiatives to improve a product that our customers seriously love. Seriously. See what Josh Senick, Senior Manager, Business Technology Operations, Slack, had to say about Halp: “The second I saw it, I said where do I sign? How do we get this, because this is exactly what I want to do. This is the tool I’ve been wanting since my first day at Slack.""
Who You Are:
A results-oriented engineer who is comfortable with higher levels of ambiguity
A proactive communicator with great follow-through
Excited about learning from your coworkers and collaborating with people with diverse perspectives
Willing to voice your opinion but okay with not always being right
Trend towards focusing on the customer problem and treating technology as a means to an end
Requirements:
At least 3 years of experience in an engineering role at a software company
An extensive background in front-end engineering and API design and implementation
Able to technically lead a product initiative from design to production
